* [snail007/goproxy (258s/61f)](https://github.com/snail007/goproxy) : proxy是golang实现的高性能http,https,websocket,tcp,socks5代理服务器,支持正向代理和内网穿透.程序本身可以作为一级代理,如果设置了上级代理那么可以作为二级代理,乃至N级代理.如果程序不是一级代理,而且上级代理也是本程序,那么可以加密和上级代理之间的通讯,采用底层tls高强度加密,安全无特征.代理时会自动判断访问的网站是否屏蔽,如果被屏蔽那么就会使用上级代理(前提是配置了上级代理)访问网站;如果访问的网站没有被屏蔽,为了加速访问,代理会直接访问网站,不使用上级代理.另外可以设置域名黑白名单，更加自由的控制网站的访问方式。下载地址:https://github.com/snail007/goproxy/releases 官方QQ交流群:189618940
